Boxroom
=========
Boxroom is an open source project that aims to develop 
a web application for sharing and managing files online. 
The goal is to let a group of people share their files 
with eachother. To make this possible the application 
lets users create folders and upload and download files 
in a web browser. Furthermore for administrators it will 
be possible to create users, user groups and the CRU/D 
rights these groups will have on folders.


Thank you for trying Boxroom!

Changed in kerinin's fork
-----------------
This fork is intended to implement Amazon's S3 as a back-end.
I'm hoping to get this running on Heroku, fyi.

* http://texticle.rubyforge.org/

== DESCRIPTION:

Texticle exposes full text search capabilities from PostgreSQL, and allows
you to declare full text indexes.  Texticle will extend ActiveRecord with
named_scope methods making searching easy and fun!

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Only works with PostgreSQL

== SYNOPSIS:

In environment.rb:

  config.gem 'texticle'

Declare your index in your model:

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    index do
      name
      description
    end
  end

Use the search method

  Product.search('hello world')

Full text searches can be sped up by creating indexes.  To create the
indexes, add these lines to your Rakefile:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'texticle/tasks'

Then run:

  $ rake texticle:create_indexes

Alternatively, you can create a migration that will build your indexes:

  $ rake texticle:migration

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Texticle may be used outside rails, but works best with rails.

== INSTALL:

* sudo gem install texticle

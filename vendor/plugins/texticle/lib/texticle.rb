require 'texticle/full_text_index'

####
# Texticle exposes full text search capabilities from PostgreSQL, and allows
# you to declare full text indexes.  Texticle will extend ActiveRecord with
# named_scope methods making searching easy and fun!
#
# Texticle.index is automatically added to ActiveRecord::Base.
#
# To declare an index on a model, just use the index method:
#
#   class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
#     index do
#       name
#       description
#     end
#   end
#
# This will allow you to do full text search on the name and description
# columns for the Product model.  It defines a named_scope method called
# "search", so you can take advantage of the search like this:
#
#   Product.search('foo bar')
#
# Indexes may also be named.  For example:
#
#   class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
#     index 'author' do
#       name
#       author
#     end
#   end
#
# A named index will add a named_scope with the index name prefixed by
# "search".  In order to take advantage of the "author" index, just call:
#
#   Product.search_author('foo bar')
#
# Finally, column names can be ranked.  The ranks are A, B, C, and D.  This
# lets us declare that matches in the "name" column are more important
# than matches in the "description" column:
#
#   class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
#     index do
#       name          'A'
#       description   'B'
#     end
#   end
